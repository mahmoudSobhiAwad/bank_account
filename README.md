## Overview
Mahmoud's Bank is a simple command-line banking application built using Dart. The application allows users to perform basic banking operations such as verifying account IDs, withdrawing money, depositing funds, and displaying account information. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, such as classes, constructors, and methods, to manage bank account operations.

The program supports error handling, input validation, and a maximum number of login attempts to enhance the security and user experience.
